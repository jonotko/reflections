When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you're working on a team based project or if you would like the ability to work remotely accross multiple devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It can get annoying if git automatically pull every single update. Sometimes an update might not even make sense to be pulled. Finally a change might affect some files you are currently working on causing bugs.
